Magma is an open-source software platform that gives network operators a mobile core network 
solution. Magma has three major components:
1. Access Gateway
2. Orchestrator
3. Federation Gateway

This project contains a set of Juju charms with the purpose of driving the lifecycle 
management, configuration, integration and daily actions for Magma.

### Lite
This project can be used instead of [Charmed Magma](https://github.com/canonical/charmed-magma) in
the cases where resources are limited. Here for example, we bundle all of orchestrator services 
into 1 charm. This will make this release lighter but not as scalable.

read the `Installation guide` section.
